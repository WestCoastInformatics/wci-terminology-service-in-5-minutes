WCI Terminology Service in 5 minutes: termcli
=============================================

This tutorial shows how to use our termcli to access content from the WCI Terminology API.

Prerequisites
-------------
* bash must be installed
* curl must be installed ([Download cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/))

The termcli creates a .termcli config file in the user $HOME directory to manage stateful configuration.
